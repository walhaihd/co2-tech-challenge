# co2-tech-challenge

A tech challenge designed for candidates, featuring a realistic simulation of Co2 emissions calculation.

## Preamble

We welcome you with our co2 emissions tech challenge.
The solution consists of two Api projects.

Measurements API - provides user's energy consumption in Watts at a specific time point.

Emissions API - provides c02 emissions factors in kg per kWh during the day.

## API Specifications

Our API works with Unix timestamps (represented by long) number of seconds
starts at the Unix Epoch on January 1st, 1970 at UTC.

### Measurements API

We encourage you to get API details from Swagger/open API specifications of this API.

#### Supported users' ids

* alpha
* betta
* gamma
* delta
* epsilon
* zeta
* eta
* theta

#### Returned data remark

Measurements API returns data in requested time frame, with resolution from 1 to 10 seconds (depends on user).

Measurements API has data up to the now.

For example: You requested data from timestamp 10 to timestamp 30, for user which has 3s resolution data
you should get values for following timestamps, 12, 15, 18, 21, ... 30.

### Emissions API

We encourage you to get API details from Swagger/open API specifications of this API.

#### Returned data remark

API returns data in requested time frame, with 15 minutes resolution.

API has data slightly ahead (until the end of the day) of the current time.

### Calculator API

We expect you to expose an endpoint which accepts 'user id', 'from' and 'to' timestamps
and returns single double value - calculated total emission for the user during this timeframe.

#### Usages note

1. API will **primarily** be used to calculate emission for multiple users **within the same timeframe**.
2. Timeframe can be quite long (up to 2 weeks)
3. TimeFrame is always sometime in the past

## Task

We expect you to create an API project called Calculator API.
Which mainly will consume two other APIs and return the total emission for requested user within requested timeframe.

### Important

**You can change existing projects codebase, but your solution will be tested against the original APIs and configs.**

## Implementation

1. We DO NOT limit you to use 3rd-party libraries, especially if they are De Facto Standard solutions to some problems.
2. We DO NOT limit you with project structure, architecture design, naming convention
   (Except reasonable and well-known in .NET)
3. We DO encourage you to use modern c# and fresh language features!

## Calculation

### Algorithm

First step is to split the measurements in 15-minute periods and calculate the amount of energy consumption (in kWh) for each period. <br>
For the calculation of kWh, we assume that the resolution (of measurement data) does not change (for each user) and that we do not have missing data. In this case, the calculation of kWh can be simplified to calculating the average (in watts) for a period, and then divide it by 4 (because we calculate for 15-mins, not for the full hour) to get the Wh, and then divide by 1000 to get the kWh <br>.
Then you should multiply the kwh with the corresponding co2 factor (based on the timestamp) to get the amount of co2 for each 15-minute period (in Kg). <br>
The last step is to sum them all together to get the total amount of co2 (in Kg) and return it.

### Example

E.g. user's measurement data = { <br>
14:00-14:15 = 0.5 kWh, <br>
14:15-14:30 = 1 kWh, <br>
14:30-14:45 = 2 kWh, <br>
14:45-15:00 = 0.5 kWh} <br>

*the measurements API does not return kWh, it returns watts, you should calculate the kWh based on the watts and the timestamps.

emission factor example ={ <br>
14:00-14:15 = 0.3, <br>
14:15-14:30 = 0.1, <br>
14:30-14:45 = 0.2, <br>
14:45-15:00 = 0.2 } <br>

total emissions = 0.5 * 0.3 + 1 * 0.1 + 2 * 0.2 + 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.75 kg 

## Chaos

To make this task more interesting, we added a bit of chaos to our APIs. Enjoy!

1. There is a chance that chaos prevents you from getting a response. (Measurements API Request has a chance (30%) to fail)
2. There is a chance that chaos makes you wait longer. (Emissions API Request has a chance (50%) to be delayed (15s))

## Technical Challenges

### 1. Calculation Challenge

Although these calculations can be done in many different ways, we want you to think over a more optimal algorithm implementation.

### 2. Chaos Challenge

As you may have read, we add some 'chaos' to our APIs, but it will be nice if your Implementation can deal with this 'chaos'

### 3. Docker Challenge

Our APIs have Docker files, but they are not working. It will be nice if you fix them, and add everything
(including your project Dockerfile) to docker-compose

## Results & Review

### How to send results

We expect to receive a link to the GitHub repository including the current solution with the Added Project from the task.

### Review criteria

Both code quality and calculation correctness (we will compare with our solution) will be reviewed by our team.

### NOTES.md

You can include any remarks, your assumptions, or other important matters concerning solution in the NOTES.md file
in the repository root.
